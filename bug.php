This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to using the ternary operator within an echo statement.  The issue stems from operator precedence and how PHP interprets the expression.

```php
<?php
echo $someVariable ? 'true' : 'false';
?>
```

If `$someVariable` evaluates to a non-empty string, it's considered 'true' and 'true' is outputted correctly. However, if `$someVariable` is an empty string or `0`, the expression is treated differently.  The ternary operator's precedence results in an unexpected output because PHP interprets the expression as `(echo $someVariable) ? 'true' : 'false'`, rather than `echo ($someVariable ? 'true' : 'false')`.

This means that if `$someVariable` is empty or 0, `echo $someVariable` evaluates to nothing (or 0), and PHP interprets it as 'false', resulting in the output of 'false'. This doesn't properly reflect the intended ternary operation, which should output 'false' only if the variable is falsy but not necessarily empty.

Another subtle aspect is that `echo` is a language construct, not a function.  This contributes to the behavior.
